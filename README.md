Git flow release finisher
===

A small and simple Node CLI tool to finish a release, following the [git-flow workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

Based on [Git flow release creator](https://github.com/hmps/gitflow-release-next) by [@hmps](https://github.com/hmps).

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `npm link` in the root folder.

This will create two CLI commands:

- `finish-release`
- `fr`

They both do the same thing, `fr` is just a shorter version.

## Usage

`$ finish-release`

Git flow release creator assumes that you can run `git-flow` commands from your CLI.
